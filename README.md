# AlgorithmLearning

This repository records my learning results about algorithms with C++ and Python.

I use C++ and Python to code. So the solution codes will be formatted as C++ and Python to illustrate.

# C++ Compiler Configures

If we want to use VSCode to compile CPP code, we would better follow these steps:

- Download the compiler source files
- Configure VSCode
- Test the environment whether it works on

For convenience, I provide a JSON file that has been configured in the right way to configure the GCC, clang, and MSVC Compilers.

## Download the source files

You need to download Mingw and MSVC from these websites:

- [GCC and Clang](https://winlibs.com)
- [MSVC](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

After installing these two programs, we need to configure our Windows environment. I really recommend you find some solutions about how to configure the Windows environment on the Internet. If I have more free time, I will give a complete path about how to configure the Windows environment.

## Configure VSCode

It is effective that you put my JSON file in your VS Code project. You must put it into a directory named ".vscode".

## Test

If anything is right, you can use "Terminal-->Run Task" to run our test codes.

> If you have any question about the install, please tell me.
